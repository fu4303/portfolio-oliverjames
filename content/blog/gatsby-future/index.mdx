I'm starting to feel like Gatsby is going to take over from WordPress as the go-to platform for general websites.

## Why WordPress was so successful

## Gatsby overview

Gatsby started life as a React-based static-site generator. It takes various data sources and uses React components as templates to generate HTML files. The big difference between Gatsby and most static-site generators is that Gatsby also creates a client-side JavaScript app. This best-of-both-worlds approach means your site renders the initial view very quickly, then continues to "boot up" into a full-blown single-page app while the user is browsing. Once enough of the "app" has been loaded navigation becomes instant and doesn't require server round-trips.

Gatsby has become incredibly popular for a few reasons:

1. Super fast by default. It's possible to make a slow Gatsby site, but out of the box it generally gets perfect scores on performance tests.
1. Easy data-sourcing. Gatsby's plugin system makes it simple to combine different sources of data: you can have markdown files in a Github repo and a Google Sheet for example.

## New Gatsby features

- [Themes](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-11-11-introducing-gatsby-themes/) hide complexity of big sites with lots of plugins
- MDX is amazing and will be even better with good CMS support
- Using JSX in MDX is way better than [shortcodes](https://www.christopherbiscardi.com/post/towards-shortcodes-for-gatsby-sites)
  - Makes creating custom content very accessible to non-technical users

## Where Gatsby outshines WordPress

- JavaScript all the things
- Dev experience
  - Vastly better performance
  - Cheap static hosting
  - Modern interaction paradigm (React vs JQuery)

## Problems Gatsby needs to solve

- Built-in CMS (Netlify CMS/Contentful aren't enough)
- Related to CMS: authentication is tough for static sites (need a server somewhere)
