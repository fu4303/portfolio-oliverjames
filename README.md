My personal website, built with [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org/)

## Developing

If for some reason you want to run this locally:

1. Clone the repo
1. `npm i` to install the dependencies
1. `npm run dev` to run the local server
1. Visit `http://localhost:8000/`

## Building

To create a `public/` directory that can be deployed to any static host, run `npm run build`.
